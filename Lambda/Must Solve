Convention :  
• We omit outermost parentheses. For instance, we write MN
  instead of (MN).
• Applications associate to the left; thus, MNP means (MN)P. This is
  convenient when applying a function to a number of arguments, as in fxyz,
  which means ((fx)y)z.
• The body of a lambda abstraction (the part after the dot) extends as far
  to the right as possible. In particular, λx.MN means λx.(MN), and not
  (λx.M)N.
• Multiple lambda abstractions can be contracted; thus λxyz.M will abbreviate
  λx.λy.λz.M.




Exercise 3. (a) Write the following terms with as few parenthesis as possible,
without changing the meaning or structure of the terms:
	(i) (λx.(λy.(λz.((xz)(yz))))),
	(ii) (((ab)(cd))((ef)(gh))),
	(iii) (λx.((λy.(yx))(λv.v)z)u)(λw.w).

(b) Restore all the dropped parentheses in the following terms, without changing
the meaning or structure of the terms:
	(i) xxxx,
	(ii) λx.xλy.y,
	(iii) λx.(xλy.yxx)x.



T = λxy.x
F = λxy.y
AND be the term λab.abF
OR=? 
NOT=?

if then else = λx.x
if then else T M N →β  M
if then else F M N →β  N
